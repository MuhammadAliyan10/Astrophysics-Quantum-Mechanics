# Quantum Mechanics Roadmap

## 1. **Basic Mathematical Foundations**

- **Linear Algebra**:
  - Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and Hermitian operators.
  - **Why?** Quantum states are represented as vectors in a complex Hilbert space, and observables are operators.

## 3. **Schrödinger Equation**

- **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation**: Governs quantum state evolution.
  - **Equation**: \( i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi \).
- **Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation**: For stationary states.
  - **Why?** Derives energy levels in atoms and molecules.
  - **Example**: Solving for the hydrogen atom.

## 4. **Postulates of Quantum Mechanics**

1. Quantum states are represented by wavefunctions \( \psi \).
2. Observables are represented by Hermitian operators.
3. Measurement collapses the wavefunction into an eigenstate of the operator.
4. Probability of measurement outcomes: \( |\psi|^2 \).

  - **Why?** Important in semiconductors and nuclear fusion.
- **Perturbation Theory**: Approximation methods for complex systems.
- **Feynman Path Integrals**: Alternative formulation of quantum mechanics.
- **Density Matrix**: Describes mixed states; essential for quantum information.

## 9. **Key Constants and Equations**

- **Planck’s Constant**: \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js} \).
- **de Broglie Wavelength**: \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \).
- **Energy Quantization**: \( E = n\hbar\omega \) for harmonic oscillators.
- **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: No two fermions occupy the same quantum state.
